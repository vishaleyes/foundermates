  <li><b>	Why do I have to sign up with LinkedIn?</b>
   </br>
<ol type="a">
<li> Signing up with Linkedin makes the registration process a bit quicker and </li><li>  We would like to know you better </li>
</ol>
</br>
<li><b>	What is in it for me?</b>
<ul >
<li>
FounderMates will help you find advisors who can help you in addressing your business challenges. Research shows that having a good advisor helps an entrepreneur to avoid making mistakes.
</li>
</ul>
</br>

<li><b>	What kind of advisors do you have on board?</b>
<ul >
<li>
Our advisors bring expertise in varied areas such as Sales, Marketing, Law, Business Strategy, Outsourcing, Social Media, Digital Marketing, IP, Brand, Litigation, Product Strategy, Raising Finance,Cloud Services etc.  
They come from various sectors such as Healthcare, mobile, telecom, media, Cloud services, Retail, Internet etc.

</li>
</ul>
</br>

<li><b>	Do I have to pay an advisor?</b><ul >
<li>
It is free to send messages to an advisor on the platform. How you choose to engage with an advisor offline, either through goodwill, or though equity/fee, is between you and the advisor and FounderMates have no say in that. As a platform we encourage you to find right advisors and then take the relationship offline to get tangible benefits.

</li>
</ul>
</br>

<li><b>I am not from the UK or India. Can I join?</b><ul >
<li>
No. At this point, we are open to advisors and entrepreneurs in the UK and India. But we plan to scale up and we will update you when we launch in other countries.
</li>
</ul>
</br>


<li><b>	How is this different from LinkedIn, Social Media, Clarity.fm or other mentoring bodies?</b><ul >
<li>
LinkedIn is for all kinds of professionals. Finding an advisor who is willing to help you and contacting him is not easy as LinkedIn prevents messages from 2nd degree and 3rd degree connections. Social Media channels have limitations in finding advisors with right skills, location and interest to help. In Clarity.fm finding a free advisor is difficult. It is highly mobile focused and does not incorporate local component like we do. Mentoring bodies and groups usually do not let you connect to advisors directly. They also ask for a fee upfront.

</li>
</ul>
</br>

<li><b>		I usually attend networking events to find advisors. How will this benefit me?</b><ul >
<li>
We have found out that networking events although great is not all inclusive. You will not get a chance to effectively network with every advisor in an event. And every advisor cannot make it to every event. Thus an online channel that helps you to find advisors can act as a great compliment to networking events.

</li>
</ul>
</br>

<li><b>	How can I find and connect to advisors on FounderMates?</b><ul >
<li>
You can search an advisor based on experience, skills, seeing his LinkedIn profile and location and then message him via the email feature within the platform.
</li>
</ul>
</br>

<li><b>	At what stage of business do I need to be to join FounderMates?</b><ul >
<li>
Anyone from a startup idea to high growth SME can join FounderMates.
</li>
</ul>
</br>

<li><b>	How do you ensure that advisors respond to my question on time?</b><ul >
<li>
We have selected quality advisors who are more than willing to advise entrepreneurs. We have asked them on principle to respond to your questions in time. Obviously, we expect you to be considerate to advisors as they are busy people, and ask pertinent questions relevant to their industry and skills. Please refrain from asking basic questions which you can find through numerous online resources.
</li>
</ul>
</br>
<li><b>	If it is free, how are you making money?</b><ul ><li>
We are working on some business models and we will incorporate them soon.
