<p><h3 style="color:#10BEF8;">Message</h3></p>
Entrepreneurs can send an email via our platform to advisors explaining their need. Advisors will then respond back to messages via our platform.
<p><h3 style="color:#10BEF8;">Review</h3></p>
After interaction between an advisor and an entrepreneur, FounderMates will ask the entrepreneur for review. Reviews are of paramount importance and we expect unbiased timely review from an entrepreneur. As this is a free platform, we expect Review as a commitment from every entrepreneur to help maintain quality of experience on FounderMates.
<p>
Based on reviews received, the "influence" scores of the advisor changes. Better reviews result in better "influence" of an advisor on the platform and a premium search listing for advisors.
