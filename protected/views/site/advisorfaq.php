  <li><b>Why do I have to sign up with LinkedIn?</b></li>
 
<ol type="a">
<li>Signing up with Linkedin makes the registration process a bit quicker </li>
<li> We would like to know you better </li>
</ol>

</br>

<li><b>How do you define an 'advisor' on FounderMates?</b></li>
  <ul >
<li>An advisor is an umbrella term on FounderMates that covers Mentors, Consultants or Advisors  who are willing to help entrepreneurs by way of advice.  </li>

</ul>

</br>

<li> <b>Is this free for both the advisor and entrepreneur? If so, where is the incentive for the advisor? </b></li>
  <ul >
<li>Yes, advisors and entrepreneurs join for free. Also, entrepreneurs can seek and receive advice for free via FounderMates.  The incentive for the advisor is many-fold. One, it's an opportunity to build his network of entrepreneurs. Second, its an opportunity for brand building and greater visibility by engaging on the platform and developing your 'influence'. Third, it provides an advisor with an opportunity to forge long term offline relationships with entrepreneurs. </li>

</ul>
</br>


<li><b>How do you ensure quality of advisors on FounderMates?</b></li>
  <ul >
<li>We primarily use an advisors' LinkedIn account for verification as of now. If we receive request from an advisor to join, as first step we will verify the LinkedIn profile. If we find inadequate information, we will call up the advisor to gather required information. We have certain criteria for advisor selection. We expect minimum 5 years of experience in one skill or sector or in case of someone who has experience as an entrepreneur previously or someone belonging to healthcare, minimum 2 years' experience is necessary. We are always on the lookout for high flyers, pro active individuals who exhibit sound professional skills along with a keen interest in startups/SMEs.  </li>

</ul>
</br>



<li><b>Can I signup both as an advisor and an entrepreneur on FounderMates?</b></li>
  <ul >
<li>No. We believe that if you are an advisor it is best you stick to that, and if you are an entrepreneur seeking help, you simply join as an entrepreneur. </li>

</ul>

</br>

<li><b>How will you differentiate from LinkedIn, Angel List or Clarity.fm?</b></li>
  <ul >
<li>We are a specialized meeting place that works like a marketplace for advisors and entrepreneurs. LinkedIn is a professional network for everyone in the professional world and one cannot connect to 2nd or 3rd degree connections easily. Angel List is primarily geared towards investors. Clarity.fm is more mobile focused and does not facilitate a meeting place like FounderMates where entrepreneurs and advisors can both make informed choices before choosing to connect or to respond </li>

</ul>
</br>

<li><b>What are my obligations as an advisor? How much and resources do I need to commit?</b></li>
  <ul >
<li>An entrepreneur can only ping an advisor and not vice-versa. So an advisor's commitment is not necessary unless an entrepreneur messages him on the platform. In this Beta release, we cannot predict a time commitment required from you. However, when an entrepreneur contacts you, as an advisor, we expect you to take up his query and try to respond to it in as timely and useful  manner as possible.</li>

</ul>
</br>

<li><b>I usually mentor against equity/fee. How will this help me?</b></li>
  <ul >
<li>FounderMates will help you to be visible to a large entrepreneur community who can connect to you based on your experience, skills and location. This will be your chance to meet entrepreneurs with some great ideas which you can take offline and negotiate for long term commitment based on equity/fee. FounderMates will have no control on how an advisor  engages with an entrepreneur beyond the platform. </li>

</ul>
</br>
<li><b>I am not from the UK or India. How can I join?</b></li>
  <ul >
<li>Currently we are open to advisors and entrepreneurs only from the UK and India. However, we are planning to scale up soon and we will let you know as we expand to other countries.</li>

</ul>

</br>




<li><b>How do you ensure I do not get flooded with hundreds of little questions? </b></li>
  <ul >
<li>We have an approval method for entrepreneur sign up. So, we will only allow those entrepreneurs who have a specific need for getting a mentor. This is just our beta platform. As we evolve more, we do have other plans to help filter out unwanted questions. </li>

</ul>
</br>
<li><b>Do you see a minimum/maximum time spent on each question? </b></li>
  <ul >
<li>No, at this moment we are not checking that. Some questions will be very easy for you and you can answer from the top of your head and some could be very challenging and might need meeting in person or arranging a phone call with entrepreneur, which is between you and the entrepreneur.</li>

</ul>
</br>
<li><b>If FounderMates is free to join, how do you generate revenue?</b></li>
  <ul >
<li>We are working on some probable business models which we will incorporate later </li>

</ul>
</br>




<li><b>If this works, great. If it doesn't work for me, do I simply stop?</b></li>
  <ul >
<li>Yes, if you plan to deactivate your profile from FounderMates, just simply send us an email and we will do the necessary. Obviously, we would not like you to leave and would like to know your feedback and your reason for departure to help us develop the product better.</li>
